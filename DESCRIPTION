Description: Compiled and cleaned the county-level estimates of fertilizer, 
    nitrogen and phosphorus, from 1945 to 2012.  The dataset were originally 
    generated by USGS based on the sales data of commercial fertilizer. 
    See <https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5851b2d1e4b0f99207c4f238/> for details.  
    Usfertilizer utilized the tidyverse to clean the original data and provide 
    user-friendly dataframe. Please note that USGS does not endorse this package and this package
    does not include manure data. Also data from 1986 is not available for now.
